    <!-- MAIN SECTION: What is ModernWeb and what it does -->
    <section>
      <h1>Why ModernWeb?</h1>
      <p>Web developers have a problem nowadays on the web. There's too many web browsers and there's too many versions
      of these browsers, some of them from more than a decade ago. ModernWeb purpose is to change that by
      helping people update their browsers and start seeing a new web. A web that loads faster and it's much
      more beautiful than before.</p>
      <p>Many things have changed since the web came to public. Today we have HTML5, CSS3 and newer versions of JavaScript
      that helps developers create a deeper user experience. Legacy browsers doesn't support these kind of technology as
      you can see on <a href="http://caniuse.com">http://caniuse.com</a></p>
      <p>As many web developers know, we have workarounds for those legacy browsers: polyfills and fallbacks. The problem is
      that the many browsers you want to support the many crap you put in your code, things like checking for features and applying then
      according to browsers capabilities.</p>
      <p>So we decided to create this banner. By using it, developers can unleash their creativity and actually show people how great
      it would be if everyone use a modern browser. In fact, this very own website use this approach, if you are seeing this on
      a legacy browser you should already be seeing the ModernWeb banner. Update to a newer browser and you should see this page render
      a little bit better and the banner won't appear.</p>

    <!-- How it works -->
    <section>
      <h1>How it works</h1>
      <p>ModernWeb works by checking canvas support on the browser. We chose this feature because it helps divide modern browsers from
      legacy ones. If you need more accurate feature checking we suggest you to use <a href="http://modernizr.com">Modernizr</a> with ModernWeb.displayBanner()
      method.</p>
      <p>If the browser doesn't support canvas we show the banner with the option to download the most popular modern browsers.
